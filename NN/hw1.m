% Hw #1 Perceptron Learning

% (a) Write a program to implement perceptron learning algorithm. 
% Assume there are R inputs and S neurons in the neural network.  
% Verify the learning using data given below.

p = [1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 ; 4 5 4 5 1 2 1 2];
t = [0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1];



% (b) Also, verify your algorithm for any multi-neuron classification problem.
