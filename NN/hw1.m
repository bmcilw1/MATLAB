% Hw #1 Perceptron Learning

% (a) Write a program to implement perceptron learning algorithm. 
% Assume there are R inputs and S neurons in the neural network.  
% Verify the learning using data given below.

p = { [1 4]' [1 5]' [2 4]' [2 5]' [3 1]' [3 2]' [4 1]' [4 2]'};
t = {0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1};



% (b) Also, verify your algorithm for any multi-neuron classification problem.
